==============================================
  TOPIC:2==> Deamonset:
A deamonsets ensures that all (or some0 Nodes run a copy of a pod.As nodes are added to the cluster,pods are
added to them.As nodes are removed from the cluster ,those pods are garbage collected.deleting a deamon 
set will cleanup the podst created.
   some typical uses of deamon sets:
---->running acluster storage deamon such as glusterd,ooph,on each node;
----> running alogs collection deamon in every node,such as fluanted or logistic
---->running a node demonetering deamon on every node such as premothery node.
